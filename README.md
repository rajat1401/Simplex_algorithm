# Simplex_algorithm
Simplex Algorithm coded from scratch as a part of Linear Optimization course assignment.  


takes A, b and C and calculates the Initial BFS and iterates to achieve min for the same.
The algorithm is implemented on Max-Flow and Min-Cut problems for a flow-network to show that they are equal.
